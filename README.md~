# SimpleSimulation, A DUECA Project

## Introduction

This is a very simple simulation project that uses [DUECA
middleware](https://github.com/dueca/dueca). It is intended as a
demonstration project, you are encouraged not to look at this project
unless you are really stuck following the instructions in the DUECA
documentation.

## Application

This project uses the "flexi-stick" module from the FlexiStick project
to read joystick input, adds a simple dynamics module to demonstrate
development and implementation of DUECA/DUSIME modules, and uses the
"world-view" module from the WorldView project to show a 3D image.
